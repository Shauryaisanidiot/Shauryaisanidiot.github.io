        <p>Hi there, I'm Shaurya, This website was actually developed by me (alone(cause i got no friends to develop with)). I used HTML for this, I could have made it more attractive using CSS and Javascript but I'm lazy to do that. This site was updated somewhere in July 2023</span>

            <p>Yea, So life's not pretty good since 17 April,2022<br>.</p>
            <p>So I have been studying in a hostel, The hostel's not good at all in my opinion. I might look happy to you but it's not my actual happiness, I'm really sad inside with life. I can't tell you everything here, If you want to know about it just sit down and talk with me. <b>Please don't break my trust</b>. Nothing interests me in life anymore, not even adult content. I only had one crush in my whole life way back in 5th class, never liked anyone after that with that intention, by intention I don't mean something sexual like on her physical appearance and all that stuff, I had some mental attraction towards her, I was a kid back then what do you expect? and I also didn't have any sexual attraction towards anyone till now.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have one sister, she's tall and thin. There's one more girl she's not my actual sister but I consider her as my sister. I have only one best friend, his name is Ryan Singla, he's like 11 inches shorter than me and around 12-13 or maybe 14 now, He was in my old school named "Yadavindra Public School" the school was known for sports and education it was ICSE (man I miss those days)...</p>
            <p>.<br>If you are a female then just note one thing, I will criticize women because of my misogyny and might even use some terms I'm not supposed to use, but that would be just external me not the internal me, but trust me I would never think or say something dirty about you or to you...(even applies to the women I don't know)<br><br><<br>
              <p> I usually listen to west old classics or English Hip hop music my favourite hip-hop group was "N.W.A" . My favourite artists are Rarin and Polo G. and as usual Dr.Dre and Eminem on the top.</p>
<br>
Here's my spotify playlist
                <ul>
                <li><a  style="text-decoration:none" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6EGKpyq4ScgaSKj2PoKPmE?si=0018446a805b4b3b">My Spotify Playlist</a></li>
</ul>
            <p>This would have been like some 1000 words essay if I didn't think of making this site family friendly.<br>I hope life will be good one day and if it doesn't then god knows what will happen to me...</p>
